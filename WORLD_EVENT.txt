To trigger the event, click on an unoccupied tile on the grid, which will spawn a Lorax entity into that tile.
As the Lorax walks around, he:
    a. Makes the surrounding grass greener
    b. Turns surrounding trees into rainbow trees
    c. Turns surrounding fairies into blue 'hyper fairies,' which move around the world faster
His walking patterns target dudes; once he reaches a dude, he plays an audio voice line and kills the dude, leaving
behind a skull.

We wouldn't say that we ran into any particularly glaring issues during this project, since the inheritance tree
for Entity made implementing the Lorax's functionality pretty easy (we simply made him a subclass of fairy, targetting
dudes rather than stumps).

Gavin - Implemented greener grass, rainbow trees, hyper fairies functionality
Miro - Lorax sprite/base code, event trigger, dude spawning, parts of Lorax's executeActivity
